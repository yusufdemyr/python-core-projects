# ### Class-Related Decorators. Task 1
# ***
# #### Description

# You need to create abstract class `Vehicle`. Classes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Truck`, `Bus` are inherited from `Vehicle` 
# and already implemented. 

# Class `Vehicle` accepts the following parameters:

# - `brand_name` -> str (e.g. Honda)
# - `year_of_issue` -> int (e.g. 2020)
# - `base_price` -> int (e.g. 1_000_000)
# - `mileage` -> int (e.g. 10_000)

# The following methods should be implemented:

# - `vehicle_type` - returns str - type of the vehicle in the following pattern *brand_name + name of the class*.
#   For example: *Toyota Car*, *Suzuki Motorcycle*;
# - `is_motorcycle` return boolean value depends on the amount of wheels (2 wheels -> motorcycle, so method should return *True*);
# - `purchase_price` - returns the price of the vehicle: (`base_price - 0.1 * mileage`). If the result price is less than 100_000, 
# method should return 100_000.

# Put the following decorators where necessary and if it is necessary:

# `abstractmethod`, `classmethod`, `staticmethod`, `property` and other decorators.

# #### Example


#     >>> vehicles = (
#         Car(brand_name="Toyota", year_of_issue=2020, base_price=1_000_000, mileage=150_000),
#         Motorcycle(brand_name="Suzuki", year_of_issue=2015, base_price=800_000, mileage=35_000),
#         Truck(brand_name="Scania", year_of_issue=2018, base_price=15_000_000, mileage=850_000),
#         Bus(brand_name="MAN", year_of_issue=2000, base_price=10_000_000, mileage=950_000)
#     )
    
#     >>> for vehicle in vehicles:
#             print(
#                 f"Vehicle type={vehicle.vehicle_type()}\n"
#                 f"Is motorcycle={vehicle.is_motorcycle()}\n"
#                 f"Purchase price={vehicle.purchase_price}\n"
#             )
    

#     Vehicle type=Toyota Car
#     Is motorcycle=False
#     Purchase price=985000.0
    
#     Vehicle type=Suzuki Motorcycle
#     Is motorcycle=True
#     Purchase price=796500.0
    
#     Vehicle type=Scania Truck
#     Is motorcycle=False
#     Purchase price=14915000.0
    
#     Vehicle type=MAN Bus
#     Is motorcycle=False
#     Purchase price=9905000.0
